# Sensu Core

[![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/sensu/core/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/sensu/core/tree/main)

Core contains the definitions for the [sensu-go](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-go) core API.

## Codegen

Both of the core api versions have some component of protobuf-based code
generation. Each works with `go generate`, however there are system
dependencies in addition to the current supported version of go. A docker
image and Makefile is available to quickly set up the system dependencies,
but is hardcoded for x86_64 & arm64.
